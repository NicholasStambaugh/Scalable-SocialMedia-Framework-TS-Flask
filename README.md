# Scalable Web Platform Framework 1.0

This is an open-source codebase for social media-esque UX developed to be extremely scalable, using `TypeScript`, `React`, and `Flask`. 

It serves as a collaborative platform for sharing and discussing books, movies, and music. The application includes user authentication, item sharing with comments and likes, real-time updates, and a responsive UI. 

It also implements robust error handling, validation, and an admin panel for moderation. The app is deployed on a server or cloud platform.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: `TypeScript`, `React`, `HTML`, `CSS`
- Backend: `Python`, `Flask`
- Database: `PostgreSQL` or `MySQL`
- Real-time Updates: `WebSocket` (e.g., `Socket.IO`)
- Version Control: `Git`

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using TypeScript, React, HTML, and CSS. The main files are:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point of the application.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the global styles for the application.
- `app.tsx`: The main TypeScript file that contains the React components and logic for the application.

## Backend

The backend of the application is built using Python and Flask. The main files are:

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file that handles the routes and requests.
- `database.py`: The file that defines the database models using SQLAlchemy.
- `auth.py`: The file that handles user authentication and registration.
- `api.py`: The file that handles the API routes for item retrieval, creation, and modification.
- `admin.py`: The file that handles the admin panel routes for moderation.

## Database

The database for the application can be either PostgreSQL or MySQL. The schema for the database is defined in the `schema.sql` file.

## Utils

The `utils` directory contains utility files for error handling, validation, and real-time updates.

## Documentation

The `docs` directory contains the `README.md` file, which provides an overview of the project and its file structure.

## Version Control

The project uses Git for version control. The `.gitignore` file is included to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
